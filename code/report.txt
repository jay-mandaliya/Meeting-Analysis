* Work done until now *
-> Latest development from my end is related to the backend database in which I have created three main tables; first is product description, second is stock information and third is browsing history.
-> The first table consists of total 5 columns, the second table is linked with first table and has three columns and the last table has 4 columns and has information related to browsing history of products which are visited by different users.
-> From now I'm planning to generate a payment work flow and integrate it with payment gateway.
-> Once the users has selected to buy products then they will be allowed to enter further information such as address and contact information.

* Work will be done *
-> I will save the order information of users in the orders table and then user will be redirected to the payment gateway to complete their order purchase.

* Issues encountered *
-> There was also a major issue with the database modelling for three tables, because all of the tables were interrelated; it was difficult to create a foreign key from product table and to join it with remaining two tables.
-> At first it was issue to fetch results without foreign key but afterwards the issue has been resolved.
