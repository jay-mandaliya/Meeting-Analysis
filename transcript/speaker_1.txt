Latest updates from my end is the homepage design of mobile application. I have created the design with bottom navigation tabs and main container. Navigation tabs are used by user to navigate to new screen. While main container consist the list of various products. The first section list most visited products and most popular products. The second section has the list of various kids products such as books and toys. The last section of the main container has the list of products purchased by women's. From now I'm focusing to work on the description page because the users after clicking on their interested product will land on description page. The description page design will take into consideration the image of product, description and the price. There was a issue regarding the custom list for products, because I have made the list in three different sections, I faced problem while scrolling the bottom list. The scrollview was stucked with their initial products and was not scrolling horizontally.
