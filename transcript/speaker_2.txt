Latest development from my end is related to the backend database in which I have created three main tables; first is product description, second is stock information and third is browsing history. The first table consists of total 5 columns, the second table is linked with first table and has three columns and the last table has 4 columns and has information related to browsing history of products which are visited by different users. From now I'm planning to generate a payment work flow and integrate it with payment gateway. Once the users has selected to buy products then they will be allowed to enter further information such as address and contact information. I will save the order information of users in the orders table and then user will be redirected to the payment gateway to complete their order purchase. There was also a major issue with the database modelling for three tables, because all of the tables were interrelated; it was difficult to create a foreign key from product table and to join it with remaining two tables. At first it was issue to fetch results without foreign key but afterwards the issue has been resolved.
